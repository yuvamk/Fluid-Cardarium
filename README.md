Responsive React App with Reusable Components

Project Overview

This project is a responsive web application built with React, featuring reusable components and designed to be responsive for both tablet and mobile screen sizes. The app demonstrates how to create dynamic, modular components and render them with different sets of data. It follows modern best practices for styling, component testing, and deployment.

The app is deployed and hosted on a free hosting platform, and you can access the live demo through the provided link (once hosted).

Features

Reusable Components: Developed two main reusable components:
Card Component – Displays an image, title, and description dynamically.
Button Component – Customizable with different labels and actions (e.g., onClick events).
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive for tablet (768px width) and mobile (375px width) breakpoints.
Engaging UI: Styled using CSS-in-JS (styled-components) for an engaging user experience that matches modern design principles.
Component Testing: Basic unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
Deployment: Hosted on a free hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

Responsive Design

The app is fully responsive for both tablet and mobile breakpoints. The layout adapts based on screen size using media queries and the CSS-in-JS library styled-components. Below are the breakpoints used:

Tablet: 768px width
Mobile: 375px width
Testing

Basic unit tests are included to test the rendering and functionality of the components. Tests are written using Jest and React Testing Library. To run the tests, use the following command:

npm test
Deployment

The project is deployed using Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. You can access the live version of the app through the following link (replace with your live site URL):
